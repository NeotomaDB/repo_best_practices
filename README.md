# Neotoma GitHub Repo Best Practices
A repo that describes the recommended practices for setting up new repositories within the Neotoma Paleoecology Database.

## Initial Set up

### Repo Name
Choose a short and identifiable name for your repo.

### Description
Add a short description of the purpose of the repo; additional description will be put in the README.

### Public vs Private
Most repos will be public or made public upon the publication of the resource.

### README
This box should be checked upon repo set up. All repos should have a descriptive README document (see below).

### Gitignore
Check this if necessary for your specific project.

### License
All repos should have an appropriate license. The MIT license is a good default for NeotomaDB repos.
